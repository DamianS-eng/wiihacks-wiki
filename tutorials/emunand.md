# emuNAND - neek2o
`emuNAND` is the term used for a few different consoles, including (but not limited to): Wii, 3DS / 3DSXL / 2DS / new 3DS / new 3DSXL / new 2DS, WiiU, and Switch.

emuNAND is the way of redirecting the internal storage of a console over to a different storage medium. In the case of the Wii, it can be to either to an SD card or USB hard drive. The main use of emuNAND for the Wii is to have your channels (WAD files) installed on to your storage device of choice, instead of limiting you to the 500MB of internal storage on your console.

The main benefit of using emuNAND over the SD card menu on the Wii is that it is not tied to the console. You can take your storage medium and put it in to another homebrew enabled console and boot in it. All of your saves (from WiiWare and Virtual Console games) are also kept within the emuNAND environment.

## Building the emuNAND
