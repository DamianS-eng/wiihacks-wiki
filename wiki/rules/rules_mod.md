Moderator rules are fully public and can be viewed by any user of r/WiiHacks. If you suspect that any moderator is in violation of a rule, please report it to the top active moderator.

# Top Active Moderator

  The current top active moderator is [/u/BloodyThorn](https://www.reddit.com/user/BloodyThorn).

  If there is anything that needs immediate attention, please direct requests towards them. If this changes the moderators and community will be notified.

  While other moderators can help out with the routine tasks of the subreddit, the ultimate responsibility for tasks such as queue maintenance is the top active moderator.

# Rules

  One of our goals is to keep this forum enjoyable and available to as many people as we can. The following ruleset was created with that in mind.

  We appreciate your help with /r/WiiHacks. The moderator position is voluntary, but with it there is some responsibility.

  1. Moderators are required to know the rules. They should be monitoring the Wiki for any changes so they can be kept up to date.

  2. All rules that apply to patrons apply to moderators. No exception.

  3. You determine your own involvement level. 

     If all you want to do is participate in the same way before you were a mod, that's fine. You are welcome to walk away at anytime, no hard feelings. If you chose to be responsible for something, you're only asked to keep up with it and hand it off responsibly.

  4. Using your status as a moderator to intimidate, threaten, garner or give favor will get your mod removed.

  5. Every moderator action you take that allows you to document, must be documented.

     Excessive actions with no documentation will get your mod removed.

  6. Stay responsive. This isn't a rule as much as a guideline. Currently reddit mail, and /r/wiihacks modmail are the only official forms of communication for the moderation of the subreddit.

     Moderators that are unresponsive in a reasonable amount of time to direct requests run the risk of being removed as dead-weight. It would be much safer to add you back later if it is a mistake, than run the risk of a dead account sitting with moderator access to the forum.

     If you plan on leaving for a prolonged duration, just make sure the active top mod knows.

# Moderation Queues and Desirable States.

  You can read the official help [here](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000090312-Reddit-Moderation-To-ols). Below are my musings on the optimum state for each queue.

  1. Mod Queue -> A Throw-all

     This is a queue with items that are needing action, minus ones that appear in the Unmoderated Queue. Auto-removals, reports, spam. Once it is resolved it will disappear. 

     It's optimal that this queue is empty.

  2. Reports -> User reports

     These are generated when anyone clicks the 'report' button. Once it is resolved it will disappear. 

     It's optimal that this queue is empty.

  3. Spam -> All removed messages

     Removed messages will remain in this folder. Messages that are removed by mistake can be approved, and ones that are removed correctly so can be marked and documented properly. Messages remain in this queue when removed for any reason. 

     Optimal queue contains only posts that have been rightfully removed with documented reason for removal.
  
  4. Edited -> post/reply edits

     "The functionality of the edited queue is the same as your main mod queue but only shows content that has been edited."

     I'm not sure I've found a use for this yet.

  5. Unmoderated -> New posts that are unapproved

     Anytime a new post is made, it generates an entry in this queue. If you click on the "Approve" check, it removes it. It's a way to ensure every post has been inspected by a mod.

     Optimal queue is empty.

# Questions or Concerns.

  If there are any questions are concerns send a modmail, the top active mod, or please direct them to /u/BloodyThorn as needed.
