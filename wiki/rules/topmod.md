# Description

  I wanted to outline what I do to actively moderate the subreddit so I can get a scope of what needs more automation.

## Watch Comments

## Check The Mod Queues

  * You can read the official help [here](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000090312-Reddit-Moderation-To-ols). Below are my musings on the optimum state for each queue.

  * For monitoring the queues, the [new reddit mod screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/WiiHacks/about/modqueue) is the best. I still tend to switch back and forth between it and the [old reddit modqueue page](https://old.reddit.com/r/mod/about/modqueue/).

  1. Mod Queue -> A Throw-all

     * This is a queue with items that are needing action, minus ones that appear in the Unmoderated Queue. Auto-removals, reports, spam. Once it is resolved it will disappear. 

     * It's optimal that this queue is empty.

  2. Reports -> User reports

     * These are generated when anyone clicks the 'report' button. Once it is resolved it will disappear. Check to make sure the report is accurate and take appropriate action.

     * It's optimal that this queue is empty.

  3. Spam -> All removed messages

     * Removed posts and replies will remain in this folder. 

     * Posts and replies that are removed by mistake can be approved and ones that are removed correctly can be marked and documented properly.

     * Posts and replies remain in this queue when removed for any reason. 

     * Determine if it indeed spam or rightfully removed. If so put a reason and address a user breaking the rules in the subreddit. 

     * If it was something that was removed as spam or by the auto-mod that shouldn't have, approve it so it gains visibility.

     * Addressed removals will have a removal reason (hover over to see on new reddit), have the flair changed to 'Removed', and the user is made aware of why the post was removed.
     
     * I've been using the removal reason templates exclusively, which automatically do two of the three things needed to address a post/reply.
     
     * Optimal queue contains only posts that have been rightfully removed with documented reason for removal.
  
  4. Edited -> post/reply edits

     * "The functionality of the edited queue is the same as your main mod queue but only shows content that has been edited."

     * I'm not sure I've found a use for this yet. I almost never look at this.

  5. Unmoderated -> New posts that are unapproved

     * Anytime a new post is made, it generates an entry in this queue. If you click on the 'Approve', it removes it. It's a way to ensure every post has been inspected by a mod.

     * Every post should be inspected to make sure it meets posting guidelines and doesn't break any forum rules. If so, approve and flair it properly.

     * Optimal queue is empty.

## Check old posts

  * Posts that are tagged question or issue older than 7 days with no activity need to be changed to abandoned, or solved/answered if they have been.

  * Best way to do this is in an [old-reddit search](https://old.reddit.com/r/WiiHacks/search/?q=flair_name%3A%22Question%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=1). 

  * Learning how to use the reddit search is strongly advised.

  * Please note that you can search on the key name of data in the search bar: (flair_name:"Question" AND subreddit:WiiHacks AND author:BloodyThorn) -> This search will bring up all posts flaired "Question" in WiiHacks, posted by me. You can leave the 'AND' out, but any other boolean must be specified.

  * Change the sort to 'new' and hit page down until there is no more to scroll to. Each post that is over limit should be inspected.
