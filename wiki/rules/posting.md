# Posting Guidelines.

  The [wiki entry](https://www.wiihacks.org/posting), and the stickied post are to remain in sync with this document.

----

## Rules.

   * Please read [the subreddit's rules](https://www.wiihacks.org/rules) before posting or replying.

## NO PIRACY.

   * Don't ask or tell where to find pirated games. Don't post about pirating games in any way shape or form. It violates rule #3.
   
   * Piracy friendly forums are often targeted legally by the legitimate I.P. holders. Being known as one puts the community at risk. If you see a link or discussion regarding piracy please report it.


## Help Requests & Questions:

   * Search first. If you ask a question or have an issue that can be resolved via a subreddit search or DDG/Google search or if it is addressed in our F.A.Q., it'll be removed.

   * If you're wondering where to start and are about to make a post to ask about it, please do not;

     [The Recommended Guide](https://wii.guide/).
   
     [The WiiHacks Wiki F.A.Q.](https://www.wiihacks.org/faqs)

   * Loader help (USBLoaderGX, cfg-usbloader, WiiFlow, etc) need to have all relevant information or they will be removed. Hardware, Software, syscheck, & SD/USB Card setup must all be provided.
   
   * Post your syscheck as a link. Posts that have syschecks in the body will be removed as they are hard to read.

   * If your post is removed for Rule #4, I suggest you read the rules before sending a ModMail or trying to post again.

### Posting a Syscheck

   * If the issue or question you have is regarding your setup, then posting a [syscheck](http://www.hacksden.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=149) to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) like [this](https://pastebin.com/agpxtvXz) is *REQUIRED*.

## Post Not Showing up?

   * If you post something that doesn't show up, be patient. Questionable links need to be approved as well as everything new accounts posts. If you've waited what you consider a reasonable amount of time send a message to modmail.

## Need to contact a moderator?

   * Modmail is the only accepted form of communication with the subreddit staff.
   * Don't PM or chat request the moderators on subreddit related issues.
