## Why does this exist?

Templates are created here and then pasted from this document. It is considered the original and should always be gone to as the source of this information. If there is a discrepancy on the ones configured in reddit, these should be consulted first.

Remember that variables from jekyll are not to be used in these templates as they must remain cut and pastable into reddit.

You can test the links embedded in this document from the wikipage.
