### Wii2HDMI, or The Lowest Cost Option

  Two brands, two prices, two options. I own the top piece of crap, and I believe u/GuitaristTom might be cursed with the bottom one. Oh yeah, if you buy one of these, I hope you like farts(ask me if you dare).

  I've also included a third alternative, supplied by u/DerpMaster2, and it's at least a reputable brand name.

#### A side note from me channeling u/WiiExpertise

  I've included three very low cost and controversial options to allow you to plug your Wii into an HDMI device. 

  Wii2HDMI, while they might suit your need, are low-grade electronic garbage. The one I own worked fine for my desktop Wii. Once I started wanting to record my Wii, it was no where close to adequate. I had to return it once due to faulty soldering and the first one falling apart.

  You've been warned. Having said that, it's still in this list.

### Mixing Board / Audio Input

  We're getting mid-range audio here. If you want to just send your signal to your computer, the above should do just fine. However if you want to have more control over your audio, as well as add additional audio sources such as mics for streaming. It's not a casual user's device.
