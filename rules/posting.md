# Posting Guidelines.

  The [wiki entry](https://www.wiihacks.org/rules/posting), and the stickied post are to remain in sync with this document.

----

## Rules.

   * Please read [the subreddit's rules](https://www.wiihacks.org/rules) before posting or replying.

## NO PIRACY.

   * Piracy violates Reddit's Terms of Service. We understand that the modding community and piracy are often intertwined, but in this case we do not allow it.
   * This includes giving or asking for sources for games or copy protected software, as well as discussion of the topic.
   * If you see someone asking for games, or posting game sites, or taking about piracy please report it.

## Help Requests & Questions:

   * Search first. If you ask a question or have an issue that can be resolved via a subreddit search or DDG/Google search or if it is addressed in our F.A.Q., it'll be removed.

   * If you're wondering where to start and are about to make a post to ask about it, please do not;

     [The WiiHacks Wiki F.A.Q.](https://www.wiihacks.org/faqs/faqs)

   * Your title must be brief and completely encompass your issue. Short titles that convey no information and long titles that give full histories and are hard to read will be removed.

   * Loader help (USBLoaderGX, cfg-usbloader, WiiFlow, etc) need to have all relevant information or they will be removed. Hardware, Software, syscheck, & SD/USB Card setup must all be provided.
   
   * Post your syscheck as a link. Posts that have syschecks in the body will be removed as they are hard to read.

   * If your post is removed for Rule #4, I suggest you read the rules before sending a ModMail or trying to post again.

### Posting a Syscheck

   * If the issue or question you have is regarding your setup, then posting a [syscheck](http://www.wii.guide/syscheck) to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) like [this](https://pastebin.com/agpxtvXz) is *REQUIRED* and must be included in your post.

## Post Not Showing up?

   * If you post something that doesn't show up, be patient. Questionable links need to be approved as well as everything new accounts posts. If you've waited what you consider a reasonable amount of time send a message to [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/WiiHacks).

## Need to contact a moderator?

   * [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/WiiHacks) is the only accepted form of communication with the subreddit staff.
   * Don't PM or chat request the moderators on subreddit related issues.
